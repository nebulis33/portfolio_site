<p>I got started with JAMstack fairly recently, maybe about 2020. It's great
    for simple sites and blogs. Admittedly I dont utilize the "A" (APIs) much,
    but thats because beyond something like comments or IG feeds, you can do everything
    yourself. Usually I use Jekyll since it's in Ruby, but I have been exploring
    Hugo and Gatsby, so keep an eye out for those.

        <p>This is my freelance site. It's seperate from this site for many reasons
            but importantly it's built on Jekyll and hosted on Netlify.

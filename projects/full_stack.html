    <p>Hello, here are a couple of my most recent full stack projects.
        I generally use Ruby on Rails, although when I get better at React
        I'll be adding some MERN apps or something. Ruby projects will basically
        always be hosted on Heroku, although AWS may make an appearance  occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that live projects use free tiers for API calls, etc. 
        This may lead to issues like no custom images displaying or no emails 
        being sent if I use up the monthly allotment on other apps. 
        All apps have a default profile that's seeded with sample data that 
        can be accessed using email: foo@bar.baz and password: foobar.
    </p>

        <p>A personal CRM app where you can store contacts and their info.
            I built this primarily because I am constantly forgetting people's birthdays.
            Then I also realized I have a hard time keeping up with friends if I
            don't see them on a regular basis, so I decided that if I could track
            interactions and have reminders I'd be better at staying in touch.

        <p>A functional clone of Facebook. This is based on a project from The Odin Project,
            but I added some additional pieces like integrating with real Facebook for login
            and using Cloudinary for image storage.

<p>Hello, here are a couple of my most recent full stack projects. 
    Please note the live projects use free tiers for API calls, etc. 
    This may lead to issues like no custom images displaying or no emails 
    being sent if I use up the monthly allotment on other apps. 
    All apps have a default profile thats seeded with sample data that 
    can be accessed using email: foo@bar.baz and password foobar.
</p>

        <p>A personal CRM app where you can store contacts and their info.
            I built this primarily because I am constatly forgetting people's birthdays.
            Then I also realized I have a hard time keeping up with friends if I
            don't see them on a regular basis so I decided that if I could track
            interactions and have reminders I'd be better at staying in touch.

        <p>A functional clone of Facebook. This is based on a project from The Odin Project,
            but I added some additional pieces like integrating with real Facebook for login
            and using cloudinary for image storage.

    <p>Data projects are kind of hard to put onto a portfolio, because
        you can't really take something from work and post it publicly.
        I use Tableau public to host any Tableau vizzes that I created.

        <p>This is a pretty involved project, so I wrote two blog posts about it
            <a class="blog-link" href="{{site.url}}/blog/2021/boba-project-part-one">here</a>
            and
            <a class="blog-link" href="{{site.url}}/blog/2021/boba-project-part-two">here</a>.
            It is a continuation
            of a prior project which used a limited dataset to analyze Bay Area boba shops, but this time
            with updated data and an attempt at a Google Cloud Services data pipeline.

        <p>This is a case study using data from bikeshare in Chicago to determine the makor differnces between
            casual users and members, and recomend marketing strategies to convert casual users to members. Again,
            this project can be found in a blog post <a class="blog-link" href="{{site.url}}/blog/2021/bikeshare-case-study">here</a>.

        <p>I wrote a web scraper using BeautifulSoup to pull all posts on the Wall Street Bets
            Subreddit that were tagged with "YOLO" or had "YOLO" in the title.  The goal was to
            see if there was any sort of trend (like more "YOLOing" when the market is up).  Sadly,
            Reddit limits the number of posts displayed in any setting to only 1000, and they eliminated
            their filter by date API, so I was only able to get 10 days worth of data before hitting
            the page limit.  It still sort of answers the original question though: "YOLOing" seems
            to happen entirely randomly and independent of the market.

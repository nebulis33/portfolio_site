<p>Data projects are kind of hard to put onto a portfolio, because
    you can't really take something from work and post it publically.
    I use Tableau public to host any Tableau vizzes that I created.

        <p>Link coming soon. When I built this site I was mostly focused
            on the coding parts, so I didn't think about which data
            projects to display. There will be a couple shortly.

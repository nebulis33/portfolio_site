<p>This is kind of a general page. Just stuff I thought was cool, like web scraper scripts
    or older projects. There's no real guarantee I will have anything to display
    here at any given time. Old stuff might get removed and maybe I haven't really
    had a need to write any other scripts or miscellaneous code since that time.

        <p>Link coming soon. When I built this site I was mostly focused
            on the coding parts, so I didn't think about which scripting
            projects to display. There will be a couple shortly.
